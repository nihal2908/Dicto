# 📚 Dicto

A flutter app that reads text aloud in small chunks — and waits for your voice commands to continue — just like a real teacher dictating notes!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔤 Enter text manually.
- 🗣️ Speaks out the text in chunks at a custom speech rate, pitch, word count.
- 🎤 Listens for voice commands like:
  - **“next”**, **“yes”**, or **“hmm”** → to go to the next chunk.
  - **“what”** or **“repeat”** → to repeat the last spoken chunk.
- ✅ Works offline using on-device TTS and speech recognition.
- 🧠 Perfect for learning, revision, or creating handwritten notes at your own pace.
